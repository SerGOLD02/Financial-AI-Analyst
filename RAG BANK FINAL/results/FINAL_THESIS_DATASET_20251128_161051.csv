*   **Net Interest Income (NII) Decrease:** NII decreased by $3.1 billion (9%) compared to 2023. This was partially due to the redeployment of commercial surplus to net trading and fair value assets.
*   **Net Interest Margin (NIM) Decrease:** NIM decreased by 10 basis points (0.10%) compared to 2023.
*   **Key Driver: Higher Interest Rates on Liabilities:** The primary driver for the NII and NIM decrease was the impact of higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. This included a shift in deposit mix towards interest-bearing deposits, meaning the bank paid more interest to depositors.
*   **Offsetting Factor: Higher Interest Rates on Assets:** The negative impact was partially offset by higher interest rates earned on interest-earning assets (e.g., loans, securities). However, this offset was not enough to prevent the overall margin decline.
*   **Loan Balance Impact:** Lower loan balances also contributed to the decrease in net interest income.
*   **Future Outlook:** The document indicates that the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) actions on interest rates will continue to impact the bank. Further rate increases could increase funding costs and potentially lead to borrower difficulties. Conversely, rate decreases could lower interest income and reduce profitability.
*   **Yield Curve Impact:** Changes in the yield curve (the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates) could also reduce net interest income and margin. A flattening or inverting yield curve could decrease margins if short-term funding costs increase relative to long-term asset yields.

In summary, higher interest rates in 2024 negatively impacted the bank's margins by increasing the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. While higher rates on assets provided some offset, the overall effect was a decrease in both net interest income and net interest margin. The bank's performance is sensitive to future interest rate changes and yield curve shifts.",9.25
