However, based on the provided text snippets, I can infer the following: 

*   **Net Interest Income (NII) Decline:** Total NII decreased by 6.0% due to lower NII in Financial Markets and Treasury.
*   **Lending NII Increase:** Lending NII rose due to volume growth, but margins stabilized.
*   **Liability NII Decline:** Liability NII decreased as deposit growth couldn't fully offset margin normalization.
*   **Financial Markets Impact:** Higher interest rates increased funding costs, negatively impacting NII in Financial Markets.
*   **Treasury Impact:** The ECB's adjustment of remuneration on minimum reserve requirements and less favorable money market conditions reduced NII in Treasury.
*   **Net Interest Margin (NIM) Decrease:** The net interest margin decreased by 11 basis points, primarily due to lower NII in Financial Markets and Treasury.

Overall, the provided text suggests that rising interest rates had a mixed impact. While lending NII increased, the negative effects on liability NII, Financial Markets, and Treasury resulted in an overall decline in NII and NIM.",0.9
